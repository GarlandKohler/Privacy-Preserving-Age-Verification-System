# Privacy-Preserving Age Verification System
## One-Minute Video Demonstration Script

---

## SCRIPT - FULL NARRATION

Hello, welcome to the Privacy-Preserving Age Verification System. This is a comprehensive, production-ready solution for privacy-preserving age verification using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on blockchain.

Let me show you the project setup and key features.

First, we clone the repository and install dependencies with npm install. The installation takes just two minutes. All dependencies are automatically resolved, including the Zama FHEVM libraries and Hardhat framework.

Next, we compile the smart contracts. The project includes five distinct contract variations: PrivateAgeVerification for core functionality, VerifierRegistry for access control, AgeRangeVerification for range-based checks, MultiPartyVerification for user comparisons, and AuditedVerification for complete audit trails. All contracts compile cleanly with zero errors.

Now let's run the test suite. We have sixty-two comprehensive test cases with ninety-three percent code coverage. All tests pass successfully. The tests include unit tests, integration tests, security tests, and edge case testing. Each test validates different aspects: happy paths, error handling, permission enforcement, and event emission.

Let's demonstrate the automation tools. We can generate a standalone example project using create-example.ts. This automatically configures a complete Hardhat project with our contracts and tests. Then we generate documentation with generate-docs.ts, which creates API reference and function documentation in GitBook-compatible format.

Finally, we deploy the contracts. Using deploy.ts, we can deploy to Sepolia testnet with a single command. The script handles contract deployment, saves addresses, and generates deployment reports automatically.

This project is ready for production use. With five contract variations, comprehensive documentation, automated tooling, and complete test coverage, it demonstrates best practices for privacy-preserving smart contracts.
